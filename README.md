# LHL_MidtermProject

## Project/Goals

The goal of our project is to analyze the trend of the popularity of different bubble tea shops in Montreal, Canada.


## Process

Step 1 - Figuring out what variables we would use to assess the popularity of bubble tea shops

Step 2 - Filtering out and cleaning the data

Step 3 - Gathering all the necessary data we are using to run our regression model

Step 4 - After analyzing the regression model, we will be drawing conclusions from our results

Step 5 - Translating our findings into visualizations to better explain our findings


## Results

â€¦


## Challenges

Our biggest challenge for this project was trying to figure out how to properly push and pull changes from Github as we are collaborating on the project together.

Another challenge we had was using the Google Places API, we had some difficulty working around the limit of 20 results showing up. Through using the time function, we managed to increase the limit to 60.


## Future Goals

If we had more time, we would analyze other potential variables that we believe could affect our findings.

We could focus more on certain districts within the same city or notice if there was a significant difference between other cities to obtain a more thorough analysis on our data.
